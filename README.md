# Calculator
This is a simple 4-operation calculator written in JavaScript with an HTML & CSS
frontend for my CSC436 Web Applications course. Our instructor gave us a 
model written in Java that ran off of terminal I/O, and an example of a working
GUI. I modified the HTML to accept user input and wrote a logic.js file off of
the Java file, modifying it to listen for both mouse clicks on the GUI and 
to also accept user input.
